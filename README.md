## A Gantt chart should calculate the schedule — not just draw it

Most Excel Gantt templates are static timelines.

They can display dates and colored bars, but they do not understand the logic connecting activities. When one task slips, successors must be checked manually. Critical activities can change without warning. Floats, deadlines, progress curves and reporting can quietly become inconsistent.

**ProjectEngine turns the workbook into a real scheduling system.**

Define the WBS, dates, progress, calendars, constraints and dependencies. ProjectEngine calculates the network, propagates changes, identifies the Critical and Longest Paths, measures float, surfaces planning risks and keeps the Gantt, analytics, Dashboard and S-Curve aligned.

All inside the Excel environment your organization already uses.

---

## What happens when one activity slips?

| Static Excel Gantt | ProjectEngine |
| --- | --- |
| Successor dates are reviewed manually | Dependency logic propagates the change |
| Critical activities may be missed | Critical and Longest Paths are recalculated |
| Float is absent or maintained separately | Total and Free Float are recalculated |
| Conflicts can remain hidden | Structured `INFO`, `WARNING` and `STOP` diagnostics identify them |
| Reporting can drift away from the schedule | Gantt, analytics, Dashboard and S-Curve consume the same calculated planning data |
| Alternatives require duplicated workbooks | TEST and SCENARIO workflows evaluate changes before they are applied |

> **Most Excel Gantt templates draw schedules. ProjectEngine calculates them.**

---

## Built for complex project environments

ProjectEngine is designed for people who need a dependable planning model, not a decorative timeline:

- planning engineers and schedulers;
- project controls and PMO teams;
- project managers working primarily in Excel;
- engineering, EPC, construction and infrastructure projects;
- shipbuilding, manufacturing and industrial programmes;
- teams familiar with Microsoft Project or Primavera P6 but working without access to those licenses;
- organizations where Excel is available everywhere but additional software is not.

ProjectEngine can also distinguish criticality across multiple projects in the same workbook, supporting programme-level analysis rather than treating every activity as part of one undifferentiated schedule.

### Where it fits

ProjectEngine does **not** claim to replace every capability of Microsoft Project, Primavera P6 or a full enterprise project management suite.

It fills a different gap:

> **Professional dependency-driven scheduling for teams that need to remain in Excel.**

## Get started

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/TMailletFR/ProjectEngine/releases/latest).
2. Download the `ProjectEngine_*.xlsm` workbook from **Assets**.
3. Open it in Microsoft Excel and enable the workbook's macros.
4. Use the integrated Quick Start guide on the WBS sheet.
5. Enter activities, hierarchy, dates, progress and dependencies.
6. Run **Planning Update** to calculate and publish the schedule.
7. Review diagnostics, then explore the Gantt, analytics, Dashboard and S-Curve.

The WBS onboarding is available in **English and French** and includes:

- Required / Optional / Calculated field indicators;
- contextual help for every input column;
- an integrated Quick Start guide;
- automatic localization when the workbook language changes.

```

1. Build the WBS and define task types, calendars, dates, progress and dependencies.
2. Add hard constraints or deadlines when required.
3. Run Planning Update.
4. Resolve any blocking `STOP` diagnostics and review `WARNING` or `INFO` messages.
5. Analyze Critical and Longest Paths, float, Driving Logic, deadlines and project health.
6. Evaluate focused changes in TEST mode or create a complete SCENARIO.
7. Review predictive differences before applying validated results with LOCK.
8. Refresh the reporting view needed for the next planning or management review.

## Why the results remain consistent

ProjectEngine is not a collection of disconnected worksheet macros.

The scheduling engine is the **single source of truth**. Simulation, diagnostics, visualization and reporting reuse its outputs rather than implementing their own competing date logic.

| Domain | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime workflow | Macro lifecycle, nesting, controlled abort and deferred display |
| WBS / DataSync | User inputs and synchronization into canonical calculation tables |
| Core calculation | Network logic, calendars, constraints, activity dates, LOE and rollups |
| Analytics | Critical / Longest Path, float, deadlines, variance and schedule health |
| Output writers | Controlled full or partial publication to protected workbook outputs |
| Gantt | Timeline refresh, rendering, geometry, interaction and drag simulation |
| Simulation | TEST, SCENARIO and LOCK services using the existing Core |
| Dashboard / S-Curve | Executive reporting and time-phased progress analytics |
| Diagnostics | Message preparation, console policy, history, alarms and acknowledgement |
| Canonical contracts | Shared identity, parsed network and incremental-calculation contracts |

This separation makes the workbook easier to validate, maintain and extend without weakening the determinism of the planning model.

## Feedback shapes the roadmap

The original feature backlog has reached a mature state. The next useful improvements should come from planners, project controls professionals and teams using ProjectEngine on schedules the project has not encountered yet.

Useful contributions include:

- a planning workflow that is difficult to represent;
- a missing relationship, calendar or reporting need;
- an unexpected result on a real schedule;
- an onboarding point that was unclear;
- a performance issue on a large programme;
- a feature you rely on in Microsoft Project or Primavera P6 but miss in Excel.

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TMailletFR/ProjectEngine/issues) for reproducible problems and feature requests, or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/TMailletFR/ProjectEngine/discussions) for broader planning questions and ideas.

When reporting an issue, remove confidential or company-specific data before sharing any workbook or screenshot.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is ProjectEngine just another Excel Gantt template?</strong></summary>

No. A template mainly visualizes dates. ProjectEngine calculates a dependency network, propagates schedule changes, analyzes path and float, manages constraints, supports simulations and keeps its reporting layers aligned with calculated planning outputs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does ProjectEngine replace Microsoft Project or Primavera P6?</strong></summary>

Not in every use case, and it does not claim to. Dedicated scheduling platforms cover broader enterprise, resource and portfolio requirements. ProjectEngine is designed for teams that need genuine scheduling capabilities while remaining inside Excel.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do users need to know VBA?</strong></summary>

No. The released workbook is intended to be used through its Excel sheets, controls and integrated onboarding. VBA knowledge is only relevant for people who want to inspect, maintain or extend the source.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can it manage more than one project?</strong></summary>

Yes. ProjectEngine includes multi-project criticality analysis so a programme can distinguish project-level criticality instead of treating every activity as one single project network.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I test a delay without changing the live WBS?</strong></summary>

Yes. TEST mode supports focused non-destructive changes, while SCENARIO mode supports complete schedule alternatives. Validated simulation results can be applied through the controlled LOCK workflow.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which languages are supported?</strong></summary>

The workbook onboarding and planning messages support English and French, with global and per-module localization controls.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where should I download ProjectEngine?</strong></summary>

Use the prepared `.xlsm` workbook attached to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/TMailletFR/ProjectEngine/releases/latest). Do not use GitHub's automatically generated source archives when you want the ready-to-run workbook.

</details>
